I obtained Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from **Free University of Berlin** in 2020. My Ph.D. supervisor was [Prof. Katinka Wolter](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=JqtocLYAAAAJ&hl=en). I received my Bachelor's degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in 2013, and M.Eng degree from Tongji University in 2016.
