I am a Research Fellow in the School of Computer Science at University of Birmingham. I am now working with [Prof. Aad van Moorsel](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=FawbTj8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) on **Machine Learning Privacy**, **Federated Learning** and **Trustworthy AI**. 

I obtained Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from **Free University of Berlin** in 2020. My Ph.D. supervisor was [Prof. Katinka Wolter](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=JqtocLYAAAAJ&hl=en). I received my Bachelor's degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in 2013, and M.Eng degree from Tongji University in 2016.
