My research interests encompass three major domains, each presenting a wide range of advanced possibilities. In the realm of **Dependable and Secure Machine Learning**, I explore pivotal concepts including Federated Learning, Inference Attacks, Differential Privacy, and the interesting frontier of Machine Unlearning. Additionally, my expertise extends to **Distributed Data Synthesis**, involving the development of Tabular Data Synthesis Models, the nuanced practice of Distributed Learning using Tabular GANs, and the rigorous evaluation of Synthetic Data. 

Beyond these pursuits, I'm strongly dedicated to propelling application-oriented and **Interdisciplinary Research** initiatives. This dedication is rooted in my extensive involvement in collaborative projects that bring together experts from diverse backgrounds, fostering a comprehensive approach to intricate challenges. My exploration of interdisciplinary research encompasses critical areas such as Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence, Financial Inclusion, and the intricate landscape of Socio-technical Systems, among other dynamic intersections.
